The questions 2,3,11,12 and 13 should be handed in as “examination questions”.

Answers:

2. GT:AD:BQ:DP:FA

3. In the second subfield (AD) of the genotype field.

11. Yes, both samples have a nonsynonomous TP53 mutation.

12. In both tumor samples there are 0 reads supporting the reference allele and 59 reads supporting the alternative allele of the nonsynonomous TP53 mutation.

16: Median values of alternative allele frequencies in HCC1143
Normal=0
Tumor ~ 0.3
80% Tumor + 20% Normal ~ 0.23
60% Tumor + 40% Normal ~ 0.18
40% Tumor + 60% Normal ~ 0.13
20% Tumor + 60% Normal = 0

Median values of alternative allele frequencies in HCC1954
Normal=0
Tumor ~ 0.25
80% Tumor + 20% Normal ~ 0.2
60% Tumor + 40% Normal ~ 0.15
40% Tumor + 60% Normal ~  0.1
20% Tumor + 80% Normal = 0
