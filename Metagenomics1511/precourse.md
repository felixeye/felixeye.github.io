# Pre-course Material

**Unix/Linux Tutorial**

* Introduction and chapter 1 + 2 in [http://uppnex.se/unixtut/](http://uppnex.se/unixtut/)  

* You must use [http://bellard.org/jslinux/](http://bellard.org/jslinux/) to try the commands in the tutorial, otherwise the commands will not work.  
If you have any questions regarding this tutorial contact: martin.dahlo@scilifelab.uu.se  

* Using Linux is often the hardest part of the course, so being familiar with writing things on a command-line will help.  
You should at least go through the exercises in the tutorial, no need to know it by heart.  

**Using UPPMAX**

* Make sure that you can login to UPPMAX from your computer before the course starts. Follow these instructions:

* It is possible to use Mac, Unix/Linux or Windows. (Windows will require installing a special program that you'll find in the instructions.)
