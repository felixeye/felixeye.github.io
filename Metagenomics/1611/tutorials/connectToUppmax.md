# Part 1: Connecting to UPPMAX  
---

Before moving on to the exercises, you will first need to connect to Milou on Uppmax through ssh.   

**Instructions for mac**  
If you have a Mac, first check if you will be able to use X forwarding. 
It is included in older macs but was removed in the latest releases where you need to install it (see: [http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201341](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201341)). 
Then start the terminal (black screen icon). 

**Instructions for PC**  
If you work on a PC, download and start MobaXterm (you can download it here: [http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)).  


You will be using half a node (*8 cores*) per person. This means you will end up sharing one node for two people as one node consists of 16 cores.
It is essential to log in with X forwarding (-X) option to be able to display graphical interfaces across remote computers.
Type the following command but replace *username* with your login name.  

1. Connect to Uppmax:

```sh
ssh -X username@milou.uppmax.uu.se
```

2. The next command will reserve a compute node for *the next 8 hours*.  
**The following command should be run only once a day otherwise you will be using more than 8 cores and others might not be able to connect.  
Go to the next step if you already run step 2 today**  

```sh
salloc -A g2015028 -t 08:00:00 -p core -n 8 --no-shell --qos=interact &
```

3. Type the following command to see the node you are affected to: 

```sh
squeue -u username
```

4. The *nodelist* column gives you the name of the node that has been reserved for you.  
To log in to compute node run the following command (replace *mXX* with the actual compute node you are assigned to)  

```sh
ssh -X mXX
```
5. Make sure that you can launch graphical tools in your node by typing this command:  

```sh
xclock
```

If you see the clock then you should be able to launch GUI-based tools such as MEGAN or Artemis remotely. Close the clock.

6. Load all necessary softwares to complete all exercices
```sh
source /proj/g2015028/nobackup/single_cell_exercises/scripts/modules_load
```

Now we can check that all softwares have been correctly loaded, please type the following command in your terminal and check that all element of the list below is listed.  

```sh
module list
```

* bioinfo-tools
* trimmomatic/0.32
* spades/3.1.1
* IDBA/1.1.1-384
* quast/2.3
* prodigal/2.60
* blast/2.2.29+
* bwa/0.7.5a
* picard/1.92
* artemis/15.0.0
* MEGAN/4.70.4
* Ray/2.3.1-mpiio

**Please contact the teachers if one of those softwares do not appear in your list.**

Next, before you are able to use a specific bioinformatics tool it needs to be first loaded using the 'module load' command.  
For example, You can view the list of available modules by typing:  
```bash
module avail
```
This will list all the basic tools available but you won't see any bioinformatics tools available.  
Type q to return to the command prompt. To see the bioinformatics tools installed on Milou, type:  
```bash
module load bioinfo-tools
```
Then type:  
```bash
module avail
```
Now, you will see the bioinformatics tools installed on Milou that are categorized by the type of main tasks they perform.
