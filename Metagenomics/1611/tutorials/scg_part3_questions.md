# Part 3 Questions: Single cell genome assembly

<p class="bg-warning">If you get disconnected from Uppmax [click here](lostConnection) to know how to get back </p>

## Questions:

**Q3.1:** Did you notice how many reads were discarded in the pre-processing? Do the numbers differ between the Miseq and Hiseq datasets? You can use the group google spreadsheet to see the results for all the datasets.  

**Q3.2:** Did you notice any differences between HiSeq and MiSeq data and the different assemblers?  

**Q3.3:** Did you notice the impact of trimming, is it the same for all assemblers?  

**Q3.4:** What do you think is the best way to assess the 'quality' of an assembly? (e.g. total size, N50, number of predicted ORFs, completeness)  

**Q3.5:** What do you think is the best way to assemble this particular SC dataset? Why?  

**Q3.6:** What is the identity of the organism based on the analyses you have performed? What phylum does it belong to and is there any closely related organisms in the databases?  

**Q3.7:** Try to find out in what type of environment you might find similar organisms in.
