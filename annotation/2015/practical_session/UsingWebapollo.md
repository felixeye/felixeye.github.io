### Using WebApollo to view annotations

For this course, we have set up a WebApollo installation - as a reminder, the url is [http://bils-web.imbim.uu.se/drosophila\_melanogaster](http://bils-web.imbim.uu.se/drosophila_melanogaster) and the login information are your first and last name, the way you provided them during registration to the course.  

When logged in to the page, select the chromosome you have been working on from the list - this will open another page that provides access to the actual genome viewer.

Next, upload the annotations you have created to the web portal. To do that, follow these instructions:

- Click on 'File' in the top left corner of the page  
- Select 'Open'  
- Click in 'Select Files' from the 'Local Files' section  
- Select the file you wish to upload, and leave all settings at their defaults (you may wish to specify a more informative name for the new track though).

This should upload your annotation track to the page. However, remember that tracks added in this way are only temporary and will disappear if you log out or lose connection to the server.
