#Viewing data in the Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV)


In these exercises we will use the  Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV). 
IGV is installed on UPPMAX, but since you will then access it over a network connection, the graphics might be sluggish. We recommend that you download and run the browsers locally and download the files that you will look at locally. Alternative you can put the files in the webexport folder on uppmax and view them from there. More information about that further down. 

If you still want to try to run IGV on Uppmax, please refer to the 
[Uppmax page for IGV instructions](http://www.uppmax.uu.se/starting-integrative-genomics-viewer-igv-on-milou) for advice.  

##Visualising a BED, BAM or GTF file from your local computer                                                          

In IGV, select File > Load from File ... and navigate to the file of interest. From 
the file extension, IGV will automatically treat the information in the file accordingly. 

##Visualizing a BED, BAM or GTF file from URL

In IGV, select File > Load from URL ... A window will pop up and ask you to give the correct URL to the file you want to view. Paste in the URL and the file will be downloaded. From 
the file extension, IGV will automatically treat the information in the file accordingly. 



##Visualising a SAM file

If the file output is in the SAM format (file ends with .sam), which is a uncompressed test format, 
you need to convert it to the BAM format (file ends with .bam). A BAM file contains the same information as the SAM file but now it is in a binary compressed format unreadable for a human. 

To convert a SAM file to BAM format type:

     samtools view -bS fileName.sam >fileName.bam


Before the visualization, you need to sort it and then build a so-called BAM file index

     samtools sort fileName.bam fileName.sorted
     samtools index fileName.sorted.bam

Then, in IGV, just follow the instruction above for choose File > Load from File ... and select the BAM file. 
If you are running IGV locally and did the mapping on Uppmax, you will have to 
download the BAM file and the corresponding index file (.bai) from your work folder 
to your own computer first.


Going to a locus
================

In IGV, click the textbox which has the word 
Go on its right hand side. This textbox will typically contain genomic coordinates for 
the locus you are presently looking at, but it can also be used to find gene locations. 
Type locus name in it and press Enter.
