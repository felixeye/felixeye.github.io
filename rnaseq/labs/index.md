#Welcome to WABI RNA-seq tutorial packages

This page contains links to different tutorials that are used in the RNA-seq course. Some of the tutorials 
are well documented and should be easy to follow. We also supply more beta versions of labs that requires more 
from the user and may contain errors. 

## Covered labs in the course
*	[Introduction to the RNA seq data provided](intro)  
*	[Short introduction  to R](R_intro)  
*	[Short introduction to IGV](IGV)  
*	[Tutorial for mapping reads to a reference and convering them to the BAM format](mapping_reads) 
*	[Tutorial for reference guided assembly](isoform-lab)  
*	[Tutorial for de novo assembly](isoform-denovo)
*	[Tutorial for isoform-visualisation](isoform-visualisation)  
*	[Tutorial concerning RNA seq Quality Controll](QC_lab)   
*	[Tutorial for small RNA analysis](smallRNA-lab)
*	[Tutorial for differential expression analysis](diffexp-lab)
*	[Tutorial for multi variate analysis](Simca_tutorial)
 
## Beta labs 
*	[Differential expression analysis using kallisto](kallisto)
*	[Single cell RNA PCA and clustering](Single_cell_RNA_PCA_and_Clustering)
 
We will try to keep these tutorials up to date. If you find any errors or things that you think should be updated please contact Johan (johan.reimegard@scilifelab.se)
